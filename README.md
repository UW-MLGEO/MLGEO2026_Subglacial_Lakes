## The Plan

### Data Storage
How: Server storage of active lake shapefiles from an Antarctic subregion, REMA output from the same regions, and ICESat-2 data. Data will be generated by team members as outlined below, saved to an external drive, and uploaded to the server through the point of contact (Ashley).  
When: Data stored by February 16  
Where: We will be using Akshay's server to store the data and run the  model. 

### Data Generation
Scripts for data generation can be found in the Notebooks folder of this repository.  

-Olivia: validation shapefiles from literature  
-Cameron: REMA (from PGC) and bounding box excel sheet  
-Sofia: ICESat-2/CryoSat-2 Training subregion gridded product with REMA removed  
-Ashley: ICESat-2/CryoSat-2 Validation and Test subregions gridded product with REMA removed
